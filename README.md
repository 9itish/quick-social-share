# Quick Social Share Buttons

## Why use these?

I agree there are a lot of alternatives available. However, the following points make the buttons stand out.

1.  It is very lightweight.
2.  It is fully customizable.
3.  It is easy to set up.
4.  It provides a lot of options in its default states itself.

## Basic Usage

To get started, all you need to do is include necessary CSS and JavaScript files and add this markup to your webpage:

<pre><div id="quick-share"></div></pre>

Now, put the following JavaScript on your webpage.

<pre>quickShare();</pre>

At this point, you will have share buttons for four major social sites — Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn.

## Additional Options

1\. Additionally, you can choose the social sites that you want to show to your users. There are six websites for you to choose from —

Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Reddit, Pinterest

2\. By default, the buttons are all black in color. You can make them round by specifying the options in a second argument. To make the buttons round, you can use following code:

<pre>quickShare(sites,'round');</pre>

This is a list of available options.

*   **round** — Makes the buttons round.
*   **dark** — Makes buttons darker on hover.
*   **light** — Makes buttons lighter on hover.
*   **taller** — Makes buttons taller on hover.
*   **wider** — Makes buttons wider on hover.
*   **wobble-vertical** - Makes buttons wobble vertically on hover.
*   **rise** - Makes buttons float on hover.

You can also use a combination of these options or add your own custom class.
